 ## 1.Firstly let's have a look at top 10 games.
 ### we can decide that these are top 10 games by ordering them by number of games sold.

 ## 2.Years that game reviewers have loved
 ### In this query I have joined game_sales table with reviews. By doing that I was able to Query years and reviews of gamers together

 ## 3.In the next query we will look at the top rated years with more than 4 games a year
 ### The reason we are doing it is because some years have only 1 game in a year, I think it wouldnâ€™t be a good idea to put the year with less games at the top.

 ## 4. Now let's have a look at years that got dropped from the rankings
 ### At the 3rd query we dropped the years which had less than a 4 games a year, now let's have a look at what years have been droppped

 ## 6. Years that both video game players and reviewers like 
 ### In this query we have used "intersect" command to query the years that exists in both top_critic_years_more_than_four_games and top_user_years_more_than_four_games
